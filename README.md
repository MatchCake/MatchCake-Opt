# Description



## Installation
### Development Dependencies

With `python` and `pip` installed, run the following commands to install the dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry
python -m poetry install
```

With `poetry` installed, run the following commands to install the dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry install
```

## Scripting Usage
To run a single training, you can run the following command:
```bash
python -m <package_name> <your_parameters>
```
and to know the parameters you can use the help command:
```bash
python -m <package_name> --help
```

## Deployment
You will need to install Docker to run the trainings in a container. 
You can install Docker by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To build the docker image of the project you can run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t <package_name>:latest .
```

The container can be run in two different modes: 

- **release**: This mode is responsible for running the __main__.py of the current package. 
- **it**: This is a development mode that is responsible for running the container in the interactive mode.

To run a mode `<mode>` you can run the following command:
```bash
docker run --name <package_name>-<phase> --detach --rm --volume=<data_path>:/<ROOT_DIR>/data -e "MODE=<mode>" <package_name>:latest <your_arguments>
```
where `<data_path>` is the absolute path in your local machine where you want to store the data generated by the phase.
The `<ROOT_DIR>` is the root directory of the project.

There is another way you can do all of this. You can use the `docker_files/build_image_and_run.py` script. This script
will build the image and run the mode you want. You can run the script with the following command:
```bash
python docker_files/build_image_and_run.py --mode=<mode>
```
